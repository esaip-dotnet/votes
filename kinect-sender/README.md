# Vote By Kinect Project

Kinect for Windows 

## What is this?

This repository contains samples submitted by the Kinect for our Vote project in Esaip.

## Architecture

The project is developed with visual studio in C# and XAML.

## How we can vote?

The right hand is to vote "Yes", the left hand is to vote "No".
To validate this vote we need to block our left hand or right hand during 5 seconds above the shoulder. If we doesn't block our hand during 5 seconds we need to start again from the beginning.
